 * Emscripten is available under 2 licenses, the MIT license and the
 * University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.
 * Both are permissive open source licenses, with little if any
 * practical difference between them.
 * The reason for offering both is that (1) the MIT license is
 * well-known, while (2) the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source
 * License allows Emscripten's code to be integrated upstream into
 * LLVM, which uses that license, should the opportunity arise.
 * The full text of both licenses follows.
