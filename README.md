# kensc-js
This is the KENSC library,
which is part of [s2-ssedit](https://code.google.com/p/s2-ssedit/),
with a minimal C interface,
to make it accessible to JavaScript.
Also included are a build script to build the library
with [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/)
and an HTML page to use the library.
